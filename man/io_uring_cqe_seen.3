.SH SYNOPSIS

.BR "#include <liburing.h>"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The io_uring_cqe_seen() function marks the IO completion
.I cqe
belonging to the
.I ring
param as processed.

After the caller has submitted a request with io_uring_submit(), he can retrieve
the completion with io_uring_wait_cqe() and mark it then as processed with
io_uring_cqe_seen().

Completions must be marked as completed, so their slot can get reused.
.SH RETURN VALUE
None
